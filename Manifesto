We, the scientists and friends of scientists in Germany, are
assembling in Berlin and many other German cities to reiterate our
commitment to the cause of science. We are of all races, all
religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all
abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives,
and all nationalities. We are united by faith in the need for rational
thought and critical thinking.

Science is nothing less than a commitment to open inquiry, wherever it
leads. To make progress, it requires scrupulous honesty and meticulous
care in gathering and interpreting evidence; unfettered access to open
data; open discussion and frank criticism. Gradually, imperfectly,
scientists collect data, revise hypotheses, improve theories, and
publish their thinking. Only in this way does all of humanity benefit
from their efforts. This spirit exists outside of any political
system, and is independent of any political party. It is the spirit
which led the first humans to attempt to understand their place in the
world.

Throughout the centuries, across cultures, science has proceeded in
this way. [Sometimes progress has been slow or politically
inconvenient.] There have been setbacks, but it is science and
scientists which have given us all manner of modern technology, and
make our current existence possible.

This Earth Day the themes of an interconnected world,
climate, and our common ecosystem will be foremost in our minds.

For many decades, the USA has been one of the leaders in this most
noble endeavour. This Earth Day, we support our US colleagues and friends
as they face threats of silence, funding cuts, destruction
of facilities, disdain for evidence [...] given the rapid policy changes taking place in that country.

If you and your loved ones recognise the essential nature of science,
we ask/urge you to get involved, and above all, march with
us for Science on April 22, 2017. From there we will go on to
defend and celebrate science and its fundamental place in our global
society.

SCIENCE, NOT SILENCE

The March for Science is a celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Recent policy changes have caused heightened worry among scientists, and the incredible and immediate outpouring of support has made clear that these concerns are also shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter. It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted.
ON APRIL 22, 2017, WE WALK OUT OF THE LAB AND INTO THE STREETS.

We are scientists and science enthusiasts. We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone.

Science is often an arduous process, but it is also thrilling. A universal human curiosity and dogged persistence is the greatest hope for the future. This movement cannot and will not end with a march. Our plans for policy change and community outreach will start with marches worldwide and a teach-in at the National Mall, but it is imperative that we continue to celebrate and defend science at all levels - from local schools to federal agencies - throughout the world.
